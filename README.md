# DNS-Trap
Small script and installer that will move the DNS Cache into a log file to track a computer's network activity.

The script will still track all network activity, even if the user is using an "incognito" tab or browser of some sort.
In order to install the script, download the files and run the EXE or DNS_Trap_Installer.ps1.
